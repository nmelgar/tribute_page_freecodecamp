# tribute_page_freecodecamp
This was a project created as part of my course from Freecodecamp.org, "Responsive web Design Certification".
All the code was written by me, elements from the timeline were taken from https://www.softschools.com/timelines/wolfgang_amadeus_mozart_timeline/460/, 
the image has a direct link to where it was taken from. 
The project was also created as image on Figma by me. https://www.figma.com/file/OMhoykLRlovJ0M8i7Nf1RH/mozart_tribute_page?node-id=0%3A1
